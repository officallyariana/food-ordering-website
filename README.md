# food-ordering-website
a food ordering system website for my internet web tech class final project
The Online Food Ordering System is a web-based platform designed to connect customers with restaurants in a convenient and efficient way. Customers will be able to create an account, log in, browse available restaurant menus, add items to a shopping cart, and place orders online. The system also provides restaurant owners with the ability to update and manage their menus, process incoming orders, and keep track of customer details. 

This project addresses the growing demand for digital solutions in the food industry by providing an easy-to-use, reliable, and scalable system that reduces traditional ordering errors and improves customer experience.
